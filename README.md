# Fake_News_Detection

Welcome to the Fake News Detection Repository! This project aims to detect fake news articles using machine learning algorithms. We have implemented several popular machine learning models for this task, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.


## Models Implemented
### 1. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is a popular linear model used for classification tasks. In this project, we have utilized it to classify news articles as fake or real based on various features.

### 2. Decision Tree Classification
Decision Tree Classification is a non-linear model that creates a tree-like structure of decisions. We have employed decision tree classification to capture complex relationships between features and classify news articles effectively.

### 3. Random Forest Classification
Random Forest Classification is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. We have applied random forest classification to enhance the accuracy of fake news detection.

### 4. Gradient Boosting Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier is another ensemble learning technique that builds models sequentially to correct errors made by previous models. We have implemented gradient boosting classifier to further boost the predictive power of our fake news detection system.
